# Purencool Base Profile

This profile sets a Drupal 8 basic website configuration and it is strongly influenced by the standard profile in core. The main focus of this code is to implement and configure a number of contributed modules, so that the installation of the contributed modules are already enabled.

It also controls contributed modules using composer and only has a few custom modules developed by Purencool to enhance the initial installation and usability for the end user and developer. 

An example of this is an Editor and Developer role have been added giving the site builder the ability to develop the website and not be User One. An Editor will have the ability to create content without having access to any extra permissions that could create issues if implemented incorrectly.

This profile is developed in conjuction with [Purencool Local Installation](https://github.com/purencool/purencool)
