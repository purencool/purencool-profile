# Purencool base profile

This profile sets a Drupal 8 basic website configuration and it is strongly influenced by the standard profile in core. The main focus of this code is to implement and configure a number of contributed modules. So that a standard website won't need at the start of installation.

It also controls contributed modules using composer and only has few custom modules developed by Purencool to enhance the intital installation and usability for the end user and developer. 

An example of this is an Editor and Developer role have been added giving the site builder the ability to develop the website and be user one and editor the ability to create content without having access to any extra permissions that could create issues if implemented incorrectly.

This profile is developed incojuction with [Purencool Local Installation](https://github.com/purencool/purencool)
